# Steam Companion (Alfred Workflow)

### Workflow for Alfred that enables various interactions with Steam
- launches a game, directly without opening the game library
- installs a game from the library
- uninstalls a game
- creates an alias (shortcut) for a game\*
- searches the Steam Store â€“ in the App or the default Browser
- launches your wishlist
- validates game files
- activates product
- launch Steam in Big Picture (+ there is a remote trigger for this)
- automatic updates of this workflow via OneUpdater

\**creating an alias by right-clicking the game in the Steam library does not work in the current Steam version, so this is basically a workaround*
