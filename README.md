# Steam Companion (Alfred Workflow)

**Workflow for Alfred that enables various interactions with Steam**
- launches a game, directly without opening the game library
- uninstalls a game
- creates an alias (shortcut) for a game\*
- searches the Steam Store â€“ in the App or the default Browser
- launches your wishlist

\**creating an alias by right-clicking the game in the Steam library does not work in the current Steam version, so this is basically a workaround*
